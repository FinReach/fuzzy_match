= loose_tight_dictionary

Match things based on string similarity (using the Pair Distance algorithm) and regular expressions.

= Quickstart

    >> d = LooseTightDictionary.new %w(seamus andy ben)
    => [...]
    >> puts d.find 'Shamus Heaney'
    => 'seamus'

Try running the included example file:

    $ ruby examples/first_name_matching.rb 
    Left side (input)
    ====================
    Mr. Seamus
    Sr. Andy
    Master BenT

    Right side (output)
    ====================

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
